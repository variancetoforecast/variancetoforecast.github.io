title: "5 reasons why I chose GitHub Pages and Jekyll over Wordpress for my first blog"

After many months of indecision, I finally got around to creating my first blog. I'll spare you the details of why I'm creating a blog, and get straight into the underlying technology powering it. 

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages allows you to host personal project pages directly from a GitHub repository. It takes a bit of tinkering, but essentially Pages websites are built from the underlying code stored on your repository. Pages lets you do the same things as GitHub (which I'll explain below), but if the repository is named a certain way and files inside it are HTML or Markdown, you can view the file like any other website.

## Why I chose GitHub Pages and Jekyll over Wordpress

1. It's pretty easy to setup

The official GitHub pages documentation is [scarce of detail](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/). After I spent sometime searching online, the [online guide created Jonathon McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) seems to be the best guide on the internet. Jonathon breaks the process down really simply - and introduces the various components of GitHub pages in an easy to digest manner. You will be up in and running with a very clean looking blog in about an hours time. 
 
2. My website is *more* secure and quicker to load

 
3. I've forced myself to learn about Git

Wordpress and other website generators are super simple to set up and use. The benefits are that they abstract away a lot of the complexity of developing website. However, for those looking to learn more about 'programming', GitHub Pages will expose you to the underlying technology and code powering both websites and other web applications.

GitHub is a case in point. GitHub is a [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) version control system primarily used for source code management - tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is extensively used by software developers. What better way to learn about something, than by actually using it!

4. It will force me to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript

*Note the tense of the above sentence.

Pretty simple point here - configuring your GitHub Pages site will force you to learn about the basic building blocks of web development. 

5. There is lots of information out there for Jekyll and Markdown
